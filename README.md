# Machine-learning-with-stock-data

## About

A simple example of how machine learning and coding can be used to predict the future prices of stocks. This program trains on real stock data pulled from the Yahoo Finance servers, where it finds certain patterns in the fluctuations, and tries to forecast the prices in a given future. 

## OBS

This program is not meant as a serious attempt to beat to market and only take historical stock prices into consideration.
